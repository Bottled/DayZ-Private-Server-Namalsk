Known Bugs
==========

	Problem:
	If a new player is entered in the Database for the first time, they will be presented with the following
	"This server is running an incorrect version of the server side application. You cannot play on this server. If you are the server admin please contact DayZ staff."
	
	Solution:
	The player just needs to relog into the server and the issue will never happen again.
